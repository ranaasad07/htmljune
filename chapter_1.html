...> what is html?

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content


...> environment setup 

...> boiler code

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph


...> create first web page


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>THIS IS MY FIRST WEBSITE</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>MY FIRST WEBSITE</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

...> tags and elements 


The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag	Element content	     End tag
<h1>	      My First Heading	      </h1>
<p>	          My first paragraph.     </p>
<br>	      none	              none

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. 
    Empty elements do not have an end tag!

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page .
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
<img src="img.jpg">

All HTML elements can have attributes
The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
    Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws.
    In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
    If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
    If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
