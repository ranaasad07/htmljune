    <h1>what is doctype declaration - mdn </h1>
    <p>In HTML, the doctype is the required "
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> -->
        " preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from
        switching into so-called "quirks mode" when rendering a document; that is, the "
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> -->
        " doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant
        specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.
    </p>
    <h1>what is doctype - chatgpt</h1>
    <p>DOCTYPE (Document Type Declaration) HTML mein aik declaration hoti hai jo web browser ko batati hai ke document
        kaunsi HTML version ko follow karta hai. Yeh document ke shuru mein likhi jati hai aur iski basic syntax kuch is
        tarah hoti hai:

        html
        Copy code
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> -->
        Yeh declaration HTML5 ke liye hai, jo latest version hai. Is se web browser ko maloom hota hai ke yeh HTML5
        document hai aur wo isko accordingly render karta hai.

        Pehle versions mein yeh thodi si mukhtalif hoti thi, jaise ke HTML 4.01 ke liye:

        html
        Copy code
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"> -->
        Magar ab HTML5 mein sirf ek simple
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> -->
         hi kafi hota hai.

    <h1>quirks mode - mdn</h1>
    <p>In the old days of the web, pages were typically written in two versions: One for Netscape Navigator, and one for
        Microsoft Internet Explorer. When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not just start using them,
        as doing so would break most existing sites on the web. Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new
        standards compliant sites differently from old legacy sites.

        There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, limited-quirks mode, and
        no-quirks mode. In quirks mode, layout emulates behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is
        essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards. In
        no-quirks mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the desired behavior described by the modern HTML and CSS
        specifications. In limited-quirks mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.

        The limited-quirks and no-quirks modes used to be called "almost-standards" mode and "full standards" mode,
        respectively. These names have been changed as the behavior is now standardized.
    </p>
    <h1>doctype x quirks mode - chatgpt</h1>
    <p>DOCTYPE declaration ka bohat close link hai quirks mode se. Quirks mode tab activate hota hai jab DOCTYPE
        declaration missing ho ya galat ho.

        Quirks Mode:
        Quirks mode tab hota hai jab browser ko pata nahi hota ke document kis standard ko follow kar raha hai. Is mode
        mein, browser purane, pre-standards web pages ko compatibility ke liye render karta hai. Yeh mode purane
        browsers ke non-standard behavior ko emulate karta hai.

        Standard Mode (ya Strict Mode):
        Jab correct DOCTYPE declaration di jati hai, browser standard mode mein document ko render karta hai. Is mode
        mein, browser latest web standards ko follow karta hai.

        DOCTYPE aur Quirks Mode ka Link:
        Correct DOCTYPE: Agar correct aur proper DOCTYPE provide kiya gaya ho, to browser standard mode ko activate
        karta hai. Jaise:

        html
        Copy code
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> -->
        Incorrect ya Missing DOCTYPE: Agar DOCTYPE declaration galat ya missing ho, to browser quirks mode ko activate
        karta hai. Jaise agar DOCTYPE declaration bilkul na ho:

        html
        Copy code
        <!-- No DOCTYPE declaration -->
        <!-- <html> -->
        ...
        Ya agar galat DOCTYPE declaration di gayi ho:

        html
        Copy code
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"> -->
        In dono soorat mein browser quirks mode mein chala jata hai aur document ko render karte waqt purane
        non-standard behavior ko follow karta hai.

        To is liye, hamesha sahi aur correct DOCTYPE declaration ko use karna chahiye taake browser standard mode mein
        document ko render kar sake aur aapka web page har browser mein consistent tarike se show ho.
    </p>
    <h1>How do browsers determine which mode to use? - mdn</h1>
    <p>For HTML documents, browsers use a DOCTYPE in the beginning of the document to decide whether to handle it in
        quirks mode or standards mode. To ensure that your page uses full standards mode, make sure that your page has a
        DOCTYPE like in this example:

        html
        Copy to Clipboard
        <!-- <!doctype html>
        <html lang="en">

        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />
            <title>Hello World!</title>
        </head>

        <body></body>

        </html> -->
        The DOCTYPE shown in the example,
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> -->
        , is the simplest possible, and the one recommended by current HTML standards. Earlier versions
        of the HTML standard recommended other variants, but all existing browsers today will use full standards mode
        for this DOCTYPE. There are no valid reasons to use a more complicated DOCTYPE. If you do use another DOCTYPE,
        you may risk choosing one which triggers almost standards mode or quirks mode.

        Put the DOCTYPE right at the beginning of your HTML document, before any other content.

        The only purpose of
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> -->
         is to activate no-quirks mode. Older versions of HTML standard DOCTYPEs provided additional
        meaning, but no browser ever used the DOCTYPE for anything other than switching between render modes.

        See also a detailed description of when different browsers choose various modes.
    </p>
    <h1>How do I see which mode is used?</h1>
    <p> If the page is rendered in quirks or limited-quirks mode, Firefox will log a warning to the console tab in the
        developer tools. If this warning is not shown, Firefox is using no-quirks mode.

        The value of document.compatMode in JavaScript will show whether or not the document is in quirks mode. If its
        value is "BackCompat", the document is in quirks mode. If it isn't, it will have value "CSS1Compat".</p>

    <h1>conslusion - Chatgpt </h1>
    <p>Quirks Mode:
        Quirks mode woh halat hai jab web browser purane web pages ko theek se dikhane ke liye kuch purane aur standard
        ke khilaaf tareeqe istemal karta hai. Yeh un pages ke liye hota hai jo 1990s aur early 2000s mein banaye gaye
        the, jab web standards utne strict nahi the.

        Kyun Zaroori hai:
        Jab HTML standard bana, purane browsers ka apna tarika tha pages ko dikhane ka. Jab naye standards aaye, purane
        pages ko theek se dikhane ke liye quirks mode introduce kiya gaya taake purane pages bhi sahi nazar aayen aur
        naye standards bhi follow kiye ja saken.

        Kaise Activate Hota hai:
        Quirks mode tab activate hota hai jab:

        DOCTYPE Declaration Missing ho: Agar aap HTML document mein DOCTYPE nahi dete, to browser quirks mode mein chala
        jata hai.

        html
        Copy code
        <!-- No DOCTYPE declaration -->
        <!-- <html> -->
        ...
        Incorrect DOCTYPE: Agar aap galat ya incomplete DOCTYPE declaration dete hain.

        Asar:
        Quirks mode mein browser kuch different aur purane tareeqon se page ko render karta hai. Yeh kuch ajeeb (quirky)
        behaviors show kar sakta hai jaise:

        Box model different hota hai (padding aur border ka size calculations mein farq hota hai).
        CSS aur HTML ke kuch rules ko differently treat karta hai.
        Standard Mode:
        Jab sahi DOCTYPE diya jata hai, to browser standard mode mein chala jata hai, jahan woh latest web standards ko
        follow karta hai.

        Example:
        Agar aap chahte hain ke browser standard mode mein chalay, to yeh DOCTYPE use karain:

        html
        Copy code
        <!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>

        <head>
            <title>Standard Mode Example</title>
        </head>

        <body>
            <p>Yeh page standard mode mein render ho raha hai.</p>
        </body>

        </html> -->
        Aur agar DOCTYPE nahi dete:

        html
        Copy code
        <!-- <html>

        <head>
            <title>Quirks Mode Example</title>
        </head>

        <body>
            <p>Yeh page quirks mode mein render ho raha hai.</p>
        </body>

        </html> -->
        Is example mein, pehla page standard mode mein render hoga aur doosra quirks mode mein, kyunki doosre mein
        DOCTYPE missing hai.

    </p>
</body>

</html>
